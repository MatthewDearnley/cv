         <li><strong>Writing HTML and generally playing with technology of all sorts</strong></li>
         <p>I have always been drawn to technology, and in 2014 I went back to college to study IT at level 3. Since passing my course, I have kept a blog on Wordpress writing about professional wrestling. I have recently undertaken a course on Udemy covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
         <li><a href="https://www.altprowrestling.com"><strong>Watching and blogging about Pro Wrestling</strong></a></li>
         <p>I have watched pro wrestling since I was a small child, and I continue to watch it now. I have found that I prefer independent wrestling to the main stream WWE, so I created a blog to share some of the best pro wrestling from around the world. This is a passion project and keeps me busy in my spare time.</p>
         <li><strong>Going for walks on the Downs and going to the gym.</strong></li>
         <p>Health and fitness may be important to me, but I'm bad at it. I get out quite regulary but could do more. I would like to visit the gym more than I do but that's how life goes sometimes.</p>
         <li><strong>Watching comedy on TV, streamed live online, or in person at a venue.</strong></li>
         <p>I have seen an array of comeidans live including: Billy Connolly, Eddie Izzard, Lee Evans, Jimmy Carr, Sean Lock, and more. I'm proud of the comeidans I have seen live, but look forward to seeing more in the future. I also have been streaming live comedy during the lockdown with shows like The Covid Arms and Jason Manford's Weekly Stand Up.</p>
         <li><strong>Loving my Cat and my wonderful fianc√©e.</strong></li>
         <p>I am engaged and we have a cat. The cat rules the house, as she should.</p>
